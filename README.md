# CS305

Client Summary:
Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. They requested implementation of secure software practices to protect sensitive financial data and ensure secure client communications. Specifically, they needed secure data verification through checksums and secure HTTPS communications.

Security Vulnerabilities & Value:
The implementation of SHA-256 hashing and HTTPS/SSL encryption was particularly well executed. The code demonstrates strong practices in:

Secure data transmission through HTTPS
Data integrity verification using cryptographic hashing
Proper certificate management
Vulnerability testing and remediation

Secure coding is crucial because financial institutions are prime targets for cyber attacks. Security adds value by:
Protecting client financial data
Maintaining regulatory compliance
Building client trust
Preventing potential financial losses from breaches

Vulnerability Assessment:
The most challenging yet helpful part was the dependency check analysis, which revealed several vulnerabilities that needed addressing. The process of analyzing and reducing these vulnerabilities through refactoring provided valuable insights into security testing protocols.
Security Layers:
Security was increased through multiple layers:

Implementation of HTTPS/SSL encryption
SHA-256 hashing for data verification
Secure certificate management
Input validation and error handling
Security headers implementation

Future vulnerability assessments should use:

Automated security scanning tools
Dependency checks
Penetration testing
Code review tools
Security headers analysis

Functionality and Security Verification:
The code's security and functionality were verified through:
Successful API endpoint testing
Dependency vulnerability scanning
Certificate verification
Checksum verification
Error handling testing

The refactored code was checked for new vulnerabilities using dependency-check reports, which showed a reduction in vulnerabilities.

Useful Resources and Tools:
Key tools and practices included:
Spring Boot framework
SSL/TLS configuration
SHA-256 implementation
Dependency checking tools
Security headers
Git version control

Portfolio Highlights:
For future employers, I would highlight:
The secure REST API implementation
Cryptographic hashing implementation
SSL/TLS configuration
Vulnerability assessment and remediation process
Clean, well-documented code with proper error handling
The complete security report demonstrating understanding of security principles

The project demonstrates practical experience in secure software development, cryptography implementation, and security testing - all valuable skills in today's cybersecurity-focused development environment.
